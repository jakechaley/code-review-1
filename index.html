        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated from
          <span class="highlight bg-blue">Boise State University</span> in 2018
          with a degree in Communications. Since graduating and moving to
          Portland, I've been kind of wandering aimlessly from job to job
          without really knowing what I want for a career. When I met one of my
          best friends, Josh, in 2019 I had no interest in programming. To be
          frank, it was something that seemed so daunting and inaccessible. It
          seemed like something I would never think twice about since I'm not
          really a computer person. It wasn't until Josh noticed I was
          continually unhappy with my work that he mentioned maybe I would like
          programming. Well, it <em>only</em> took 3 years of him getting on my
          back about it for me to actually do it, and now that I've begun, I
          have an itch for it... I'm extremely excited to be venturing down the
          journey that is programming and I can't wait to see where it takes me.

            When I'm not in class or working on a new project the place I want to
            be is on stage. I've played/written music for as long as I can
            remember and it's my absolute favorite thing. There's nothing quite
            like playing something you wrote at full volume and full energy. Other
            than music, here are some other things I love:
